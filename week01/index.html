        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>There wasn't really any reading besides going over the syllabus for this class.</p>
        <p>I purchased an access code for sitepoint.</p>
        <p>I also was able to set up Github Pages.</p>
        <p>Something interesting that I learn from the git it together video, was how to undo a staged change. I never
            knew how to, but all you have to type is "git reset HEAD (the name of the file).</p>
        <p>There was also a lot of other great information about how to use Git and Github. How to pull, push, or merge
            code, or how to work with branches, etc.</p>
