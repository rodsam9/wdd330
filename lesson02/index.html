        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <h4>Master Mobile UX videos</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I learned that it's better to have nav bar at the bottom of the screen, since it's easier for users
                to
                click on the bottom of the screen without having to use there other hand to reach the top of the
                screen.
            </li>
            <li>When designing it's better to start small then tweak up things as you go to bigger devices. It can
                be a
                mess when you start designing on bigger screens than try going small.</li>
            <li>I learned some strategies that allow users to have an easier way to fill out forms. Instead of
                having
                labels to the side, have them inside the input box, and don't ask for too much information. Give
                user
                the option to choose email or phone number and make it short and sweet.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Object-Oriented Programming in Javascript</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Have encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance when it comes to object oriented programming.</li>
            <li>You can use the keyword "this" inside a constructor function or class declaration.</li>
            <p>Example: function Person() {
            <p>this.name = 'Sam',</p>
            <p>this.age = '23'}</p>
            const person = new Person();
            </p>
            <li>Instances of a class inherit all methods and properties of its prototype.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
