        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <h4>JSON WEB TOKENS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You use json web tokens to safely transmit info between parties as json object.</li>
            <li>They are mainly useful for authenticaiton and information exchange.</li>
            <li>A token looks like the following, xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Develop, Debug, Learn</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Today many just depend on somone else's code and just call it a fix. This needs to change. We need to
                learn by developing our own code and debug along the way.</li>
            <li>It's time to rethink tooling. Instead of creating more code to patch up our old code, we should learn
                from the debugging and developing of new code.</li>
            <li>You can't know it all. And that's normal!</li>
            <li>This is our world to build!</li>
        </ul>
