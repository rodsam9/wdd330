        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>There will always be bugs and errors when it comes to progrmaming. Learning how to test and debug will
                help you be achieve tasks quicker.</li>
            <li>There are different kinds of errors, such as system error(problem with the system), programmer
                error(maybe incorrect syntax or typos), and user error(user has entered data incorrectly)</li>
            <li>Using exception can be very useful for a programmer to deal with errors.</li>
            <li>You want the errors to fail loudly when programming, so it's important to ensure your code checks for
                errors or bugs. </li>
            <li>Use strict mode to get better quality code. When not using it, it's like you're on sloppy mode coding.
            </li>
            <li>A very basic form of debugging is using alert(), because a program is stopped till user clicks on OK.
            </li>
            <li>Exception handling can be very useful to debug as well. When an exception occurs, the program ends with
                error message.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Single Page Applications</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>These are websites that re-render the content when clicking on links.</li>
            <li>This is done without making a request to the server to fetch html.</li>
            <li>Internal SPAs are limited to one entry, while location based SPAs you can share the link and not have to
                worry about the user not seeing the same view as you.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>HTML5 Template</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Template element is used to define a reusable fragment of HTML.</li>
            <li>This holds on content that will be hidden when the page loads.</li>
            <li>You can use JavaScript to display whatever is inside template tags.</li>
        </ul>
